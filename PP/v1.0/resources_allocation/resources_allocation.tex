\chapter{Resources and Tasks Allocation}
The following diagram shows the allocation of resources and tasks between the three components of the development team.
The work is scheduled more or less fairly to the three components.
The reason of doing so is that especially the first phases of the project, during which is necessary to interact and to take decisions together, is difficult to assign sub tasks.
Concerning the implementation and the testing part, the work is done in parallel by the members of the team, even though every person has his/her own activities.
