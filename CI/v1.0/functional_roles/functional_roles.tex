\section{EbayStoreCategoryFacade.java}
This class is implemented by means of the Facade pattern.
As the name suggests this pattern is used to create an architectural Facade.
In fact \method{EbayStoreCategoryFacade} has the scope of providing a simple interface for a larger and more complex portion of code

This class is used by the following class:
\begin{itemize}
\item \method{EbayEvents}
\item \method{EbayStoreHelper}
\item \method{EbayStoreOptions}
\end{itemize}

\section{ControllerViewArtifactInfo.java}

This class is a subclass of \method{ArtifactInfoBase} so it inherits all the field and methods of it.
The inherited methods are:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none, caption={Inherited methods by ControllerViewArtifactInfo.java}]
@Override
public String getDisplayName() {...}

@Override
public String getDisplayType() {...}

@Override
public String getType() {...}

@Override
public String getUniqueId() {...}

@Override
public URL getLocationURL() throws MalformedURLException {...}

@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {...}
\end{lstlisting}

\method{ControllerViewArtifactInfo} also has other methods, in addition to those inherited by \method{ArtifactInfoBase}.
These methods are:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none, caption={Other methods of ControllerViewArtifactInfo.java}]
public ControllerViewArtifactInfo(URL controllerXmlUrl, String viewUri, ArtifactInfoFactory aif) throws GeneralException {...}

public URL getControllerXmlUrl() {...}

public String getViewUri() {...}

public Set<ControllerRequestArtifactInfo> getRequestsThatThisViewIsResponseTo() {...}

public ScreenWidgetArtifactInfo getScreenCalledByThisView() {...}
\end{lstlisting}

An Artifact is a product of a software development process.

In this case \method{ControllerViewArtifactInfo} is a subclass of the Artifact class \method{ArtifactInfoBase}.
As itâ€™s possible to notice from its methods listed above, the only actions that \method{ControllerViewArtifactInfo} makes available are those of finding information about a Controller View class type.

This class is used by the following classes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \method{ArtifactInfoFactory}
\item \method{ControllerRequestArtifactInfo}
\item \method{ScreenWidgetArtifactInfo}
\end{itemize}
